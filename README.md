# Hackerrank-Leaderboard-Extractor
Program designed to extract the full name,username,score,rank,time of the top participants of a hackerrank contest.


This program was designed to automate the process of getting the details of the participants for our college's weekly contests.

Works on a combination of Selenium (because Jsoup can't execute Ajax/WebSockets or any of the JS) and Jsoup (for non Ajax data, because its faster).
